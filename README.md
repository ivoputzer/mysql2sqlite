## Why?

I needed to convert a MySQL SQL file to SQLite and couldn't find an online solution. So I wrote one.

## Todo

- [ ] Create sample SQL for testing, embedded inside `index.html` and add [Sample] button that uses it.
- [ ] Implement options like `don't remove comments`,  `custom escaping`

## Problem converting SQL file?

This was tested with only the MySQL SQL file I needed to convert. If the tool doesn't convert your SQL file as expected please create an issue. Preferably include source SQL file or a sample to reproduce the problem.
